BIG DATA ANALYTICS - TIME SERIES FORECASTING Multivariate and Univariate Machine learning SparkML and SKLearn
Problem Statement:

In most retail chains, seasonal variation in sales makes it difficult to assess the workforce  and the hiring requirements especially during holiday season. Additionally it becomes extremely difficult to predict the ratio of Full time and part time requirements during the holiday season. By Using SKLearn ML API, we can find the best fit model to predict both the full-time and part-time requirements during the holiday season

Univariate ML Predictions for time series data:

I have created a Best-fit Prediction Python Program which can be used to run various models and come up with the best fit model by using visualization and performance metrics. Technology used was SparkML

SCIKIT Learn- Multivariate/Multivariable Analysis with ML:

By Using SKLearn ML API, we can find the best fit model to predict both the full-time and part-time requirements during the holiday season
